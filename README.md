This repo is to introduce a cheap and out-of-the-box hardware setup (e.g. a Rasberry PI camera and a lens) and software to increase the dynamic range of natural scenes and/or microscopic images beyond the limited dynamic range of the used camera. Find more details in the *HDR_rasberry.pdf* file. If you have questions or comments, please contact me at <john.meshreki@uni-siegen.de>.
